# jasl -- Just Another Scripting Language

My probably crappy attempt at a programming language. Please check out the examples folder for examples! To build the actual `jasl` interpretor, probably best to just run the following in a terminal prompt:

<pre>
sh build.sh all
</pre>

Note, I have only tested this on a mac platform but it should work on linux and with a bit more work, on windows too. Since the main parsing engine uses boost::spirit, several boost headers are required and should be installed before attempting to build.

The interpretor will let you run a jasl script. E.g.:

<pre>
./jasl examples/recursiveQueens.jasl 8
</pre>

A program
---------

Every program requires a `start` entry point, and can take any number of arguments that can be extracted using the `args` keyword:
<pre>
// main entry point
start {
    // If script expects input arguments use 'args' keyword. 
    // This will put the 0th argument in the variable a. 
    // Note that a is a string.
    args 0 -> a;
}
</pre>


Variables
---------

<pre>
// This is a comment
int 5 -> a;
real 1.1 -> b;
bool true -> c;
string "Hello!" -> d;
list [This is a list] -> e;
list [This is [a nested list] list] -> f;
</pre>

Above, I create six variables, an int, a real, a bool, a string and two lists the latter of which contains a nested list 
and store them in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` and `f` respectively. ~~Note that in jasl, all variables are global.~~ This is no
longer true. Variables are now scoped at the level of a given block or returnable function. 

Functions
---------

There are two types, 'blocks' and 'returnables' the former of which can be interpreted as a void function, while the
latter is designed to return one of the above basic types.

They have this type of syntax:

<pre>
block myBlock () {

}

fn:int myReturnable() -> toReturn {

    return toReturn;
}

</pre>

Both are called with the keyword `call`:

<pre>

fn:int funk (a) -> toReturn {
    int 10 + a -> toReturn;
    return toReturn;
}

block otherFunction () {
    // Call returnable funk, put result into b
    call funk (5) -> b;
    
    // should print out 15
    echo_nl b;
}

block myFunction () {

    // Print out hello and add newline
    echo_nl "Hello";
    
    // And without a newline:
    echo "Hello ";
    
    // Variables are scoped to the function blockl
    int 5 -> a;

    // A loop that executes statements within
    // the enclosing braces several times.
    // Note that since variables are scoped to the enclosing
    // function block, the variable b will be accessible still
    // after the loop
    repeat 5 times {
        int 1 -> b;
    }

    // This is valid. Integer b is still accessible
    echo_nl b;
    
    call otherFunction ();
}

// main entry point
start {
    // Run sub-routine myFunction
    call myFunction ();
}
</pre>

Loops
-----

Three types of loop are provided. 
A while loop that has C-style syntax:

<pre>
int 0 -> i;
while (i < 10) {
    int (i + 1) -> i;
}
</pre>

A repeat loop. I think I saw this in POP-11 and I found it damn handy:

<pre>
repeat 10 times {
   echo_nl "hello!";
}
</pre>

Finally a list element iterator:

<pre>
list [this is a list] -> mylist;
for element in mylist {
    echo_nl element;
}
</pre>

If-else
-------
Conditional branching is c-style with the one exception that `if else` is not currently supported. Examples:

<pre>
if (1 < 2) {
    echo_nl "true";
}
if (2 < 1) {
    echo_nl "true";
} else {
    echo_nl "false";
}
</pre>

Handling input
--------------
As with everything else, handling input is easy:
<pre>
// start is the main entry point
start {
    // query for user input
    input "What is your name? " -> name;
    string "Hello, " -> s;
    append (s, name) -> s;
    echo_nl s;
}
</pre>

More on lists
-------------
Lists are containers of string elements that may contain nested lists:

<pre>
list [] -> emptyList;
list [just a plain list] -> A;
list [Test a [nested list] list] -> L;
list [a very [very [even more nested] nested] nested list] -> Q;
</pre>

A number of operators can be used to add elements to and extract elements from lists.

Setting tokens:

<pre>
list [hello there] -> t;
set_token (0, t, "goodbye") -> t;
// list t is now [goodbye there]

set_token (0, t, [nested bit]) -> t;
// list t is now [[nested bit] there]

set_token (1, [another list], "test") -> q;
// q is [another test]
</pre>

Getting tokens:

<pre>
// extract token 0, store in string t
get_token(0, [hello there]) -> t;

// make a new list, q
list [what the flip] -> q;

// extract token 1 from q and store in string r
get_token(1, q) -> r;
</pre>

Adding tokens (similar to `set_token`):

<pre>
// add a token to the end of a list
list [a big list] -> L;
add_token("token", L);
</pre>

Find the index of first matching token:

<pre>
index_of ("hello", [hello there]) -> s;
</pre>

Converting a list to a string:

<pre>
list_to_string [hello there] -> s
</pre>

Iterating over list elements:

<pre>
list [this is a list] -> mylist;
for element in mylist {
    echo_nl element;
}
</pre>

Miscellaneous
-------------
Getting the type of a variable:

<pre>
// suppose we need to figure out the type of a,
// use the type command and put result in a string.
int 1 -> a;
type a -> theTypeOfA;
</pre>

Releasing a variable if we no longer need it:

<pre>
real 1.1 -> d;
// some time later, after we're finished with d:
release d;
</pre>

Generating random ints:

<pre>
// generate an int in the range [0, 5]:
random_int(5) -> result;
</pre>
